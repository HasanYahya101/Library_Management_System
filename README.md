# Programming Fundamentals Term Project
## 2022 Fall

This project is a library management system that allows users to access its features by logging in or signing up.
The system allows them to store, search, add, and delete books from the library database and also allows them to lend and return books.
The data is stored in text files on the local storage and the system tracks the fines collected from late returns.
