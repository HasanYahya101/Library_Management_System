# Programming Fundamentals Term Project
## 2022 Fall (Fast Nuces Lahore)
### *>>Feel free to use the code however, you like.*

This project is a library management system that allows users to access its features by logging in or signing up.
The system allows them to store, search, add, and delete books from the library database and also allows them to lend and return books.
The data is stored in text files on the local storage and the system tracks the fines collected from late returns.

This project is implemented using **C++**. 
It follows instructions that ensure the originality of code and minimize chances of plagiarism. 
The system ensures data integrity and maintains two arrays of structs in order to store the data of Books and Lendings in the memory. 
The system is designed to be efficient and user-friendly, with features that allow users to easily access the library database and manage their book lending and returning activities.

**Note:** *You will have to add (.txt) files in your PC Manually.*

This my First College Group Project *(1st Semester)*. 
I probably wrote **In-Efficient code**, so if you whould like to change it, feel free to do so.
The Project Proposal is just different Students suggesting different Projects. 
In the end our Suggestion was not selected and a **Library Management System** (Project Proposal) was Selected.
